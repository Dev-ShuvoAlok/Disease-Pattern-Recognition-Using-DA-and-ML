# 1. Heart-Disease-Pattern-Recognition
This repo will contain multiple project where we identify pattern of hear disease from different patient  and identify new patient based on these pattern using Machine Learning

## Project: Predict Stroke
In this project We 
- attempt to predict whether or not an individual will suffer a stroke.
- perform extensive data visualization
- build multiple models and select the best performing one
- also delve in to Model Interpretation.
Moreover, We have
- Discussed Detailed About logistic Regression
- Analze threeshold importance on predictiong
- Evaluate the impact of "DATA LEAKAGE"
